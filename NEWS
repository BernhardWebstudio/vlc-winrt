Changes between 1.1.2 and 1.3.0
-------------------------------
Release: April 23th 2015

Notes:
>> Worked a lot on cleaning the code (and there's much to do left), optimizations, fixing bugs, etc...
>> 99% of our code is now shared between Windows Phone and Windows, we're basically ready for the Windows 10 SDK migration.

Changelog:
 * Updated User Interface
 * Optimisations of XAML code, which is between 50% and 130% faster (parsing and layout rendering).
 * LastFM scrobbling working on Windows
 * Browse music and videos from folders. For example if your songs are not correctly tagged, you can browse in VLC and "play a folder" just like you would play an album.
 * XAML Responsive Design enhancements : we're trying to use your screen as best as possible. On tiny screens we removed the "now playing" title which is useless, and on a big screen we give more options with extra buttons, etc.
 * Use of Windows 10 APIs via Reflection for setting a custom, orange window background color.
 * New icons, margins and alignments are more polished (even if it's still work in progress)
 * Refresh button in the Video Library, just like the Music library
 * Search videos or albums easily.
 * Updated design for Video Player (still very work in progress though)
 * Adding Semantic Zoom in the Albums view, with custom selection of ordering (by artist, by date, by album).
 * We added a back button so devices like Lumia 730 or future tiny tablets will be able to go back easily.
 * Using the same colors as VLC for Android/iOS.
Along with lots of bug fixes, etc.
 
Please don't forget:
>> This version is still far from perfect and we would like to hear your feedback. What you like and dislike, what features you want us to add, etc.
>> Windows Phone got v1.3 today however we're not releasing this update on Windows.
 
Known bugs:
 * The video player still sucks
 * Unless you play an MKV file or an uncommon video, you won't be able to choose an embedded or external subtitle, nor specify an audio track.
 * The latest Windows 10 Mobile builds are really buggy and lots of apps are crashing, so don't expect much stability over there.
